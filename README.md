# ML_Final_Proj_BERT
An implementation of the BERT model, the finetuned BERT model, on the SQuAD v2.0 on BERT Base uncased model. 

First run the Final_ML_project_bing.ipynb, download the finetunedmodel, upload it on your google drive
Then run the second file, mount your google drive, or comment out that code if you are working on the local system and correct the path for it. 

For current 2 working of the 2 epochs it will take you around 1-2 hours for fine tuning the model, which will generate a 500mb model which you can use as desired.
